## Functional programming concepts

- Immutable Data 

    Avoid using list, var (dont update or change data)
    Data and Objects should not be modified after they are created

- Closure

    In clousure functions are bundled together. 
    Clousure gives you access to functions outer scope (Lexical Scope) 

- Referential Transparency

    The value of function depends on parameters passeed to it - Not on the global state

- Modularity

    Refers to creating function/program into small independent modules which are in-dependent. i.e. Just like components into ReactJS

- First-Class Functions

    A function is said to be first class function if it can be treated as any other variable in program. i.e. It should be such that , that function can be passed as an argument to another function  + Can be assigned as value to any viriale.
     
- Maintainbility


Notes :-

- Code should be small (Fit on screen - Non scrollable)
